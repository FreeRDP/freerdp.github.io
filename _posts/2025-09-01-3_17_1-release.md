FreeRDP 3.17.1 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

We're happy to present a new release of FreeRDP.

This is a bugfix release with minor improvements and bugfixes.

* most notably a memory leak was addressed
* fixed header files missing C++ guards
* xfreerdp as well as the SDL clients now support a system wide configuration file
* Heimdal kerberos support was improved
* builds with [MS-RDPEAR] now properly abort at configure if Heimdal is used
  (this configuration was never supported, so ensure nobody compiles it that way)
