We are happy to announce that FreeRDP **2.3.2** is released.

We also apologize for not publishing updates here for the **2.3.0** and **2.3.1** releases.

This bugfix release resolves some decoding issues with smartcard and GFX channels.
It also resolved graphical issues with android based clients

As usual the tar archive can be found on
[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/) and here is the link to the
GitHub [release page](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/releases/tag/2.3.2) .

Since 2.3.1 there have been around 30 commits, from 3 individual contributors.
Additionally, since we did not publish this yet, the count from 2.2.0 is around 230 commits, from 25 individual contributors.
**Thank you all for your support!**.


Besides the mentioned fixes there are also some stability and other improvements. If you are interested
