FreeRDP 3.13.0 has just been released and uploaded to

[https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/](https://pub.freerdp.com/releases/)

We're happy to present a new release of FreeRDP.

Another bugfix and cleanup release.
Due to some new functions and fields being introduced the minor version
has been increased.

## New for application developers:
A new CMake Variable WITH_FREERDP_3x_DEPRECATED (ON by default) allows
disabling all symbols that have been marked deprecated during the 3.x
release cycle. Such a build can be used to test compatibility with future
versions that might drop these symbols entirely.

## So, what has been done:
* Friends of old hardware rejoice, serial port redirection got an update
  (not kidding you)
* Android builds have been updated to be usable again
* Mingw builds now periodically do a shared and static build
* Fixed some bugs and regressions along the way and improved test coverage as
  well
